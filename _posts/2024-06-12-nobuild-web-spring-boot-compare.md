Creating web applications with Spring Boot can be approached using different front-end technologies. This post compares three approaches: Vue.js, JakartaServer Faces (JSF), and Thymeleaf with HTMX, based on a series of tutorials

## Spring Boot and Vue.js

[Building with Vue.js](https://www.makariev.com/blog/nobuild-web-spring-boot-vuejs/) involves using Vue CLI for scaffolding the project and creating a dynamic front-end. Vue.js excels in building SPAs (Single Page Applications), offering reactive data binding and a component-based architecture. Integration with Spring Boot is achieved via REST APIs, making this combination suitable for highly interactive applications.

### Pros:

* Modern, reactive UI
* Component-based architecture
* Good for SPAs

### Cons:

* Requires separate front-end build process
* Initial setup can be complex

## Spring Boot and JakartaServer Faces
[Using JakartaServer Faces (JSF)](https://www.makariev.com/blog/nobuild-web-spring-boot-faces/) allows for a component-based framework that integrates directly with Java EE. JSF manages UI components and state on the server side, simplifying the connection to backend services.

### Pros:

* Rich server-side UI component model
* Simplified state management
* Direct integration with Java EE

### Cons:

* Can be heavy and slower compared to modern JS frameworks
* Less flexible for highly dynamic interfaces

## Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and HTMX
[Combining Thymeleaf and HTMX](https://www.makariev.com/blog/nobuild-web-spring-boot-thymeleaf-htmx/) offers a hybrid approach. Thymeleaf handles server-side rendering, while HTMX allows for dynamic content updates without full page reloads by leveraging HTML over AJAX.

## Pros:

* Simplified setup with no separate front-end build
* Server-side rendering benefits
* Enhanced interactivity with minimal JavaScript

## Cons:

* Less dynamic than a full SPA
* Limited to HTML over AJAX for interactivity

## Conclusion
* **Vue.js** is best for highly interactive SPAs needing a reactive UI.
* **JSF** is suitable for server-centric applications requiring robust state management.
* **Thymeleaf/HTMX** provides a middle ground, enhancing traditional server-side rendering with modern interactivity.

Each approach has its strengths, and the best choice depends on project requirements and team expertise. For a detailed comparison and practical examples, explore the full tutorials linked in each section.

Happy coding!
