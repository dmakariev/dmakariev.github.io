#### Welcome to Dimitar Makariev's next chapter on the web!

My old blog - [https://dmakariev.blogspot.com/](https://dmakariev.blogspot.com/) - is no longer active, but I won't delete it. It reminds me of the importance and impact of blogging. It helped me launch my career as a consultant. And it also taught me how not to maintain a blog.
Back in 2010, some of my posts gained popularity and caught the attention of the right people who helped me start my journey as a consultant.
Since then, I have worked as an independent consultant, built a small software agency with eight engineers, and delivered some amazing projects!

But life changes. Now I am mostly on my own again :) My focus now is to go back to the basics, create valuable content, engage with the audience, and explore new opportunities.
