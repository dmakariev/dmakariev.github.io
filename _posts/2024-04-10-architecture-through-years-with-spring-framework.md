While diving into [@Josh Long](https://twitter.com/starbuxman)'s ["This Week in Spring - April 9th, 2024"](https://spring.io/blog/2024/04/09/this-week-in-spring-april-9th-2024), I discovered an insightful article: ["How Spring and Java Shaped Internal Developer Platforms"](https://thenewstack.io/how-spring-and-java-shaped-internal-developer-platforms/).

🌱💻 It profoundly resonated with me, as I've personally seen how **Spring** has been instrumental in developing architectures that have gracefully evolved **over** an impressive span of **13 years**.

🔧 In the presentation I am eager to share today, we unveil the initial architecture designed **back in 2011**. At that time, the team consisted of just four individuals. Despite the small number, there was a shared conviction in the potential for growth. During my consultancy period **from 2011 to 2023**, the organization underwent an **impressive transformation**. It now boasts a large ensemble of multiple teams, with more than a hundred developers distributed across various time zones, showcasing its significant expansion. 🌍✨

Our core strategy embraced the concept of a **system of systems (SoS)**, which is the collection of multiple, independent systems in context as part of a larger, more complex system. A system is defined as a group of interacting, interrelated, and interdependent components that form a complex and unified whole. 🛠️🌐

The introduction of **Spring Boot** marked a significant milestone, simplifying our Maven POM files and streamlining deployment processes via JAR files. 📦 The evolution of front-end development through the adoption of modern JavaScript frameworks, transitioning from AngularJS to React, and subsequently to Angular, represented transformative phases in our technological journey. 

🔄 The migration to Kubernetes was perceived as a natural evolution, serving as yet another platform for our deployments. 🚀

I am thrilled to share this narrative of **innovation** and **growth**, hoping it provides both **insight** and **inspiration**. Enjoy this reflection on history and progress! 🎉📚
