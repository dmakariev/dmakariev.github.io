In the evolving landscape of machine learning, efficiency and scalability are paramount. Java developers leveraging neural networks have long sought ways to speed up the training process and manage resource utilization more effectively. The transformation from `SimpleMLP` to `SimpleMLPBatch` represents a significant leap in achieving these goals by introducing mini-batch updates and parallel execution with Java virtual threads.

In this blog post, we will build upon our previous [“Enhancing Java Neural Networks: Boosting MNIST Digit Classification with Apache Commons Math”](https://www.makariev.com/blog/enhancing-java-neural-networks-boosting-MNIST-digit-classification-with-apache-commons-math/) and use the MNIST Dataset described in [“Exploring the Classic MNIST: A Benchmark for Machine Learning Models”](https://www.makariev.com/blog/exploring-the-classic-MNIST-Benchmark-for-machine-learning-models/).

# Prerequisites
Before we dive into the development process, ensure you have:
* JBang installed on your system. You can install it from [JBang's official website](https://www.jbang.dev/download/).

* You can clone the `https://github.com/dmakariev/examples` repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmakariev/examples.git
cd examples/artificial-intelligence/neural-network-compare
```

# From Stochastic to Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
The original `SimpleMLP` model implemented a stochastic gradient descent approach, updating weights after each training example. While effective for smaller datasets, this method showed its limitations when it came to larger-scale problems. The `SimpleMLPBatch` modification embraces the concept of mini-batch gradient descent, where updates are made after processing a batch of training examples, offering a balance between the efficiency of batch gradient descent and the robustness of stochastic approaches.

By integrating mini-batch updates, `SimpleMLPBatch` improves convergence, allowing for more stable and faster training over batches of data rather than individual data points. This is particularly advantageous when training on massive datasets, as it provides a middle ground for computational efficiency and training stability.

# Implementing a Learning Rate Scheduler 
A constant learning rate can be suboptimal, leading either to slow convergence or overshooting the minima in the loss landscape. `SimpleMLPBatch` and `trainMLP_batch_Mnist` introduce a learning rate scheduler, a dynamic adjustment strategy that fine-tunes the learning rate during training. This allows the network to make larger updates to the weights when the error gradient is steep and smaller updates when approaching a minimum, facilitating a faster and more precise convergence.


# Leveraging Java Virtual Threads for Parallelism
One of the most exciting features of `trainMLP_batch_Mnist` is its utilization of Java virtual threads. This takes advantage of the lightweight threads introduced in recent Java versions for parallel execution of training operations. The concurrency model offered by virtual threads efficiently handles numerous tasks with minimal overhead, making them ideal for parallelizing batch processing.

This parallel execution ensures that each mini-batch update can be processed independently and simultaneously, substantially reducing the training time. It also allows the neural network to scale with the hardware, utilizing multiple cores and threads, which is particularly beneficial for training on multicore processors.

# Seeing the Results in Action
As we run our training script `trainMLP_batch_Mnist`, we print out the network's accuracy at the end of each epoch, observing as it (hopefully) increases with each pass. The excitement comes in watching the network's predictions improve, transforming from random guesses to confident, accurate classification.
