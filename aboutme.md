Hi. My name is **Dimitar Makariev**. Let’s hop on a call — [book here](https://crosspaths.me/dmakariev)

### Professional Summary

* Over **two decades** of professional experience in **Java** and **Spring** technology
* Master of Science in **Applied Mathematics**
* Specialized in designing and developing complex, scalable, and distributed web systems, using agile methodologies, microservices, cloud computing, and **domain driven design** 
* Developed an **expert system** for the privacy domain space with a rule engine and a knowledge base with an **AI inference engine** that calculates the risk and completeness score of the assessments
* Worked as an **independent consultant** in the San Francisco Bay Area for several years, leading and influencing the architecture of various **enterprise projects**

According to Malcolm Gladwell, becoming an expert requires 10,000 hours of practice. That means working 40 hours a week for 5 years. I have done that and more, and I have learned from some of the best minds in the industry. I can confidently say that I am an expert.
