### Introduction

I'm a Java software developer and consultant with a master's degree in applied mathematics from Sofia University. I started my software career in 1999 and have been using the Spring ecosystem since 2005. I have extensive experience in Java technologies and various open source frameworks, such as JPA, JAX-RS, AngularJS, React and Grails. I specialize in designing and developing complex, scalable, and distributed web systems, using agile methodologies, monoliths, microservices, cloud computing, and domain driven design. I have also worked with portal technologies, web services, security, NoSQL, messaging, and BPMN. One of my notable projects was developing an expert system for the privacy domain space, which uses a rule engine and a knowledge base with an AI inference engine to calculate the risk and completeness score of the assessments. I have been working as an independent consultant in the San Francisco Bay Area since 2011.
